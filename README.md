GEdit Autocomplete
==================

This plugin provides a popup with the possible completions available in the 
opened documents. This version is the very same of Alin Avasilcutei 0.9.6 and 
the only difference is that instead of using Tab to complete, it's now using 
Enter. This change is useful to make the plugin play nice with the snippets 
plugin - a super useful built-in plugin that no one could live without.
