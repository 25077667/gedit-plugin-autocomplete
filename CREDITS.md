There are a lot of completions plugins in the Gnome GEdit Plugins page, and I 
don't know what one was the first but this one is a product by:

- Initial version: Osmo Salomaa <http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit/>
- 0.9.6: Alin Avasilcutei <http://gedit-autocomp.sourceforge.net/>
- 0.9.6-Return: Fabio Nagao <http://zend.lojcomm.com.br/>
